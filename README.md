# Fraternity & Sorority Life (FSL) Web Prototype

## Project Overview

This project is a redesigned web experience for the **Fraternity and Sorority Life (FSL)** section of the Colorado School of Mines SAIL website. The goal is to provide clear, centralized information about each Greek life chapter and key events (such as rush) for students interested in joining. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The deliverable for this project is a **complete website demo** that the client can use as inspiration or integrate into their existing deployed site. The client does **not** plan to deploy this specific demo as-is. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Team

## Problem Statement

Students interested in Greek life need a straightforward way to:

- Learn about each fraternity and sorority chapter.
- Understand what each group offers and how they differ.
- Find information about events such as **rush** and other FSL-related activities.

The current experience is fragmented and not tailored specifically to these exploration needs. This project aims to design a focused FSL page that solves this problem through improved information architecture and UI/UX. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Users & Context

**Primary users:**

- Students (especially first-years and transfers) who are interested in exploring Greek life options.

**Usage context:**

- The site is primarily **informational**.
- Users browse to compare chapters, learn about events, and decide which organizations to engage with.
- The page is expected to be accessed via the web, through the broader SAIL website. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

## Definition of Done

The project is considered **“done”** when:

1. A **fully designed website demo** for the FSL section is completed.
2. The demo clearly communicates:
   - Information about each Greek life chapter.
   - Key events such as rush.
3. The design is in a state where:
   - The client can use it as a **reference or inspiration**, or
   - It can be **integrated** into the exis
